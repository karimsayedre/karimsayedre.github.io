        <h2>Integration into Hazel Engine</h2>
        <p>The journey to integrate AMD's Stochastic Screen-Space Reflections (SSSR) into the Hazel engine was both
            challenging and rewarding. Initially, Hazel did not support HLSL shaders, which are crucial for AMD's SSSR.
            Recognizing the potential of HLSL, I integrated it into Hazel, even though Hazel primarily supports Vulkan.
            This was a significant step that required a deep understanding of both the Hazel engine and the Vulkan API.
            The integration of SSSR was further facilitated by the prior implementation of Screen Space Reflections
            (SSR), as both require a Hierarchical Depth Buffer. Thus, the path was paved for SSSR, making its
            integration much smoother and more efficient.</p>

        <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
        <p>
            SSSR, also known as Stochastic Screen-Space Reflections, is a state-of-the-art screen space algorithm. To
            optimize the rendering process, I decided to remove the stochastic part of SSSR due
            to its excessive noise and less-than-ideal results in the AMD demo. Instead, I opted for cone tracing which
            was recommended by Cherno to allow for rough reflections. The color buffer is preconvoluted into mips, the
            mip to sample is decided based on the distance and
            roughness of the surface being shaded, utilizing the cone tracing algorithm, providing a more realistic and
            visually pleasing result. You can
            learn more about SSSR and its implementation from the <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-sssr/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">official repository</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Results and Impact</h2>
        <p>The integration of SSSR into the Hazel engine had a significant impact. It outperformed other algorithms that
            I had implemeted before, including SSR without a Hierarchical Z-Buffer, which
            I had incorporated in my early work in Beyond (my university final year project). The performance
            optimization from the Hierarchical Z-Buffer (HZB) was particularly impressive,
            especially considering the limitations of the previous implementations. Also, compared to AMD's stochastic
            algorithm was again, too noisy and not temporally stable. The cone tracing algorithm I implemented was more
            stable and visually pleasing.</p>
        </p>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA) works well with SSSR, and it's an area where performance can be improved
            without sacrificing too much quality. I also plan to implement ray traced reflections, and
            perhaps even a hybrid of both ray traced reflections and SSSR. You can learn more about hybrid reflections
            from <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-hybrid-reflections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the integration of SSSR into the Hazel engine has been a resounding success. It has not only
            improved the realism and flexibility of the engine but has also paved the way for future enhancements. The
            experience and knowledge gained from this project have been invaluable and will undoubtedly be beneficial in
            my future endeavors. As I continue to explore and implement new features.
